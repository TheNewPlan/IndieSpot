# IndieSpot

IndieSpot is a website that features a login method which allows users to access a database of music that is fed through a seed file into the database.

Users can then interact by saving it to their account and logging out, and then can return at any point to modify their preferences at their whim.

There is a lot more ideas that I have for this project, and I plan to continue building off this current working build.
